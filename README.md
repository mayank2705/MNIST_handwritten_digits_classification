# MNIST_handwritten_digits_classification
MNIST Dataset is the collection of handwritten digits. It contains labels of digits and Matrix of 28X28 pixels.
When grouped in plotting then it will be shown a digit.

# Algorithm
Used k-Nearest Neighbors classifier for classification of digits.
The k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm is a simple, easy-to-implement supervised machine learning algorithm that can be used to solve both classification and regression problems.
